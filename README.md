You can make alias for running ``new_problem.sh`` in your ``.bashrc`` in $home like this:<br>
```
alias pp='/mnt/c/Users/Abdalrahman/Documents/GitHub/Problem-Solving/new_problem.sh'
```
So, run $pp then paste the name of the Problem, a cpp file with that name and the code in temp.cpp will be created
